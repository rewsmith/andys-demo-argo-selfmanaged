# Demo: deploying Tyk self-managed platform with ArgoCD

Warning: this is a demo project - not production ready. 

Follow along to deploy 2 environments with ArgoCD and Tyk Self-Managed.
You will need a license for Tyk Self-Managed. You can register for a free trial: https://tyk.io/sign-up/#self. 

This demo is based on the blog post: 
* [Deploying an API gateway to Kubernetes with ArgoCD](https://tyk.io/blog/deploying-api-gateway-kubernetes-with-argocd/)

## Create local Kubernetes cluster for staging and production

In this demo, we will assume 2 environments (staging and prod) running in minikube:

```
minikube start -p staging
minikube start -p production
```

Later, to list the clusters:

```
minikube profile list
```

Then to switch cluster use kubectx:

```
kubectx staging
kubectx production
```

## Deploy staging

Follow the steps from [./staging/README.md](./staging/README.md)

## Deploy production

Follow the steps from [./production/README.md](./production/README.md)
